Building the Executable
If you want to build the executable version of this script using PyInstaller, follow the steps below.

1. Install PyInstaller
If you donâ€™t have PyInstaller installed, you can install it using pip:
pip install pyinstaller

2 Build the Executable
Once you have PyInstaller installed, you can convert the Python script into a standalone executable using the following command:
python -m pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed keylog.py

This will generate the executable file inside the dist folder.

3. Run the Executable
Navigate to the dist folder and run the executable:

cd dist
keylog.exe
